To convert the .jar file to a .exe that automatically checks for java and
downloads it if it is not found do the following:

1. Download jsmooth (http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/)

2. Open the .jsmooth file found in this folder. It is the
   jsmooth project fot converting the .jar to a .exe.

3. Make sure the .jar is found and the information in the 
   project is correct and then compile the project. A 
   standalone .exe file, that can be used to distribute the
   application, will be saved in the directory specified in
   the jsmooth project.

Note: You need to run the wizard as Administrator to be able to
automatically copy the settings to the OpenVPN folder.

To convert the .jar file to a .exe that automatically checks for java and
downloads it if it is not found do the following:

1. Download jsmooth (http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/)

2. Open the .jsmooth file found in this folder. It is the
   jsmooth project for converting the .jar to a .exe.

3. When you open the jsmooth project file check that the Executable
   section has a value for the "Executable Binary" and that the 
   Application section has the right values for "Main class" (vpn.Main)
   and "Embedded jar settings" (Use an embedded... is selected and the
   jar is chosen)
   
4. To make the exe download java if not present, check the Skeleton
   section. The "Autodownload wrapper" prompts the user for a download
   if java is not present.

Note: You need to run the wizard as Administrator to be able to
automatically copy the settings to the OpenVPN folder.

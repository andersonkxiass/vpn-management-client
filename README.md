VPN Configuration Wizard
=================================
Description
-----------

The purpose of this Java Application is to make setting up a VPN connection easier. 

The application uses openssl to generate a .key file and a request that is 
sent to an API. The API responds by sending an sms to the users mobile 
phone. The wizard asks for the password and sends it to the API. 

If the password is correct the API sends a link to a .zip
file with all the configuration files needed for the VPN connection.
The wizard downloads this zip and tries to extract it in to the proper
folder. If it fails it asks the user to extract the settings manually.

The backend for this applications is also open source and can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/futurice-oss/vpn-management-server)
